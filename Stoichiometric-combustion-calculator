# Stoichiometric-combaution-calculator
Aim: a) To calculate the stoichiometric coefficient for alkanes, alkenes and alkynes 
b) To simulate various plots depicting the effect of number of atoms on stoichiometric coefficients by comparing alkanes, alkenes and alkynes respectively
We have been given a standard reaction which depicts the formation of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen by burning if fuel, which is as follows, 
C_(n ) H_(2n+2)+ar(O_2+3.76N_2 )â†’aCO_(2 )+bH_2 O+cN_2       
Here, 
ar = stoichiometric coefficient 
a = number of moles of carbon-dioxide
b = number of moles of water 
c = number of moles of nitrogen
Please note that, after theoretically calculating the stoichiometric coefficients for alkanes, alkenes and alkynes, 
we then code the same process in MATLAB in order to plot and find out the effect of number of moles and stoichiometric coefficients for 
different gases and state their results in conclusion.
